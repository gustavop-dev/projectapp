    Income entry of the accounting module.

    A single model covers expected income (projection), liquid income
    (actually received) and lost income (written off): they share the same
    shape and the core dashboard question — expected vs liquid difference —
    becomes a single-table aggregate. A liquid record may point to the
    expected record it fulfills via `expected_income`.

    Every aggregate filters `kind` explicitly, so `LOST` rows drop out of
    the projection and the utility without any of them having to know the
    kind exists.
