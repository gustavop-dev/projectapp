    Expense entry of the accounting module.

    Partner amounts represent each partner's share of the expense.
    Every expense draws from money already in the pocket, so new expenses
    keep a linked pocket OUT movement in sync (see accounting_service);
    records created before the linkage existed stay unlinked.

    ``deduction_type`` marks the rows that are a discount taken out of an
    income before it landed (a Wompi fee, a bank fee, a withholding). The
    expected income keeps its GROSS total, so a deduction reduces utility
    like any other expense and additionally counts as payment credit toward
    its ``source_income`` (liquid children + linked deductions must add up
    to the parent's gross total for it to read as paid). It never touches
    the pocket: that money never entered the account.
