"""Settling an expected income that was collected short.

A client pays through Wompi, a bank or a withholding agent, and what lands is
4-10% below what was invoiced. That gap is not an unpaid balance — nobody will
ever collect it — yet the plain "Liquidar" action leaves it open forever,
because the pending amount is derived from the expected total minus its liquid
children.

This service closes the loop in one atomic operation: it registers what was
received and resolves the rest — deductions become linked expenses that count
as payment credit against the GROSS expected total, follow-ups move their
amount into their own expected record. The arithmetic that governs everything:

    pending = total - already_paid          # paid = liquid children + linked deductions
    received + deductions + follow_ups + unassigned = pending
    new parent total = total - follow_ups   # deductions keep the income gross

The income stays gross so the deduction can reduce utility as a real expense
without double-counting (the liquid total alone no longer carries the loss).
With no allocations the parent is untouched and the behaviour is identical to
today's liquidation. Whatever is left unassigned simply stays pending, so a
user who does not want to decide yet is never forced to.

``received`` may be zero when deductions and follow-ups cover the whole
pending: nothing was collected, so no liquid child is created and nobody is
notified — the settlement is pure bookkeeping that closes the residual.

The codebase already prescribed this workflow manually — see the error raised
when writing off a partially collected record in
``IncomeRecordCreateUpdateSerializer.validate``: *"Reduce su monto y registra la
diferencia como un ingreso perdido aparte"*.
