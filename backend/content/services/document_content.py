"""Canonical ``content_json`` construction for markdown documents.

``Document.content_json`` is not derived automatically — no signal, no
``save()`` hook — so every writer has to build it. Keeping that dict in one
place is the point of this module: the shape used to be copy-pasted across the
panel views, the MCP tools and the management commands, and the one writer that
forgot the copy (``create_estimate_document``) shipped documents whose PDF
download answered 400 while their markdown was perfectly fine.
