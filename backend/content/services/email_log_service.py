"""Single writer for the log rows an automated send leaves behind.

Every notice of the accounting module reaches N recipients and produces N
``EmailLog`` rows, so each service used to repeat the same
``for recipient: EmailLog.objects.create(...)`` block twice — once for the
failure path and once for the success one. Worse, the record the notice was
about survived only inside a free-form ``metadata`` dict, which the history
could not query: asking "what went out for this hosting" meant reading JSON
by eye.

``record_send`` writes the rows, the shared body and the ``EmailLogTarget``
links in one place. The digest notices name several records at once, which
is why the links are their own rows instead of a column pair on the log.
