/**
 * Running balance of the pocket ledger.

 * Pure on purpose: the page accumulates over the rows the filters LEFT, so the
 * Saldo column always adds up to what is on screen. Over the unfiltered set it
 * returns exactly what the old `pocketWithRunningBalance` store getter did.
 *
 * Chronological by `movement_date`, ties broken by `created_at`: two movements
 * dated the same day only have an order because one was written first.
