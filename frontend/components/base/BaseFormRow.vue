<script setup>
/**
 * A row of form fields whose controls line up.
 *
 * Wrap the fields in it instead of writing `<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-3">`
 * by hand. The row owns three shared bands (label / control / hint) and each
 * `BaseFormField` inside inherits them, so the controls start at the same height
 * even when one label wraps to two lines and the other does not — and the line
 * below stays square when only one field carries an error. Explanatory help is
 * rendered once below the whole group instead of reserving a blank hint cell in
 * every column.
 *
 * Below the breakpoint the fields stack in a single column: no bands, so no
 * reserved space is left over, and the DOM order is the reading order.
 *
 * More fields than columns is fine — they wrap, each line aligns on its own, and
 * the row's `gap` still separates one line from the next.
 *
 * The fields must be *direct* children for the subgrid to have a row to inherit.
 * One nested inside another component still renders fine (it falls back to the
 * plain stacked field); pass `standalone` on it to say so explicitly. A child
 * that is not a field and should span the row needs the bands too, e.g.
 * `class="panel-portrait:col-span-2 panel-portrait:row-span-3"`.
